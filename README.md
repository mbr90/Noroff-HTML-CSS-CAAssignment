Cross-course project for the front-end developers course at Noroff School of technology and digital media

## Description

The first iteration of this site was a result of the course assignment for HTML and CSS at Noroff. It was supposed to be a properly functioning, responsive website. With several pages and functionality as per the assignment brief. 

The next iteration was to add JavaScript to the site, for form validation and fetching information from an api among other things. 

More functionality will be added to this site as my studies progress. As my skills improve I envision that I might design the site from the ground up again, as there are some choices that I would make differently at this stage of my developer journey
